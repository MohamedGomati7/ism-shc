                                 take children to a nursery or a babysitter prior to enrollment in the
                                 school.<br> This will help with the discomfort and stress of separation
                                 between parents and child.<br> Also, please remember that children will
                                 pick up on your anxieties and tend to become more distressed if their
                                 parents are upset.<br> Please remain calm for your child.
